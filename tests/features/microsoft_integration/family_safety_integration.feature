Feature: Microsoft Family Safety Integration
  As an administrator
  I want to validate and integrate with Microsoft Family Safety
  So that I can leverage existing time management without duplication

  Background:
    Given I have administrator privileges on the system
    And Microsoft Family Safety is configured for the family
    And the admin interface is accessible

  Scenario: Microsoft Family Safety connection validation
    Given Microsoft Family Safety is configured with family accounts
    When I test the Family Safety integration
    Then I should see successful connection to Microsoft Family Safety service
    And I should see family member accounts detected: ["daniel", "parent1", "parent2"]
    And I should see current time management policies for each member
    And I should see operational hours configuration for each member
    And I should see content filtering status for each member
    And I should receive confirmation that local policies will not conflict

  Scenario: Time management policy synchronization verification
    Given Microsoft Family Safety has time limits configured
    And Daniel has 1.5 hours on weekdays and 4 hours on weekends  
    When I verify time management integration
    Then I should see current time limit settings displayed correctly
    And I should see remaining time for today calculated accurately
    And I should see operational hours displayed correctly (9AM-9:30PM weekdays, 9AM-10:30PM weekends)
    And I should see bonus time allocation capability confirmed as working
    And I should confirm that local system will not duplicate time tracking
    And I should see that Microsoft Family Safety will handle all time management

  Scenario: Bonus time allocation testing via mobile interface
    Given a parent has the Microsoft Family Safety mobile app
    And Daniel has 30 minutes remaining for today
    When the parent grants 1 hour bonus time via mobile app
    Then the system should detect the time limit change within 5 minutes
    And Daniel's remaining time should show 1 hour 30 minutes
    And I should see the bonus time allocation logged in the admin interface
    And the bonus time should expire at midnight automatically
    And tomorrow's time should reset to normal daily allowance

  Scenario: Content filtering policy coordination
    Given Microsoft Family Safety has content filtering enabled
    And local security policies block alternative browsers
    When I verify content filtering integration
    Then I should confirm that Microsoft Edge is the only available browser
    And I should confirm that Microsoft Family Safety filters are active in Edge
    And I should see that VPN applications are blocked by local policy
    And I should see that portable browsers are blocked by local policy
    And I should confirm that content filtering cannot be bypassed
    And I should receive confirmation that layered protection is operational

  Scenario: Family Safety policy conflict detection
    Given Microsoft Family Safety has app time limits configured
    And local policies have application control restrictions
    When I run policy conflict analysis
    Then I should see analysis of overlapping policy areas
    And I should see confirmation that policies are complementary, not conflicting
    And I should see that Microsoft Family Safety handles time limits
    And I should see that local policies handle security boundaries
    And I should see that no duplicate restrictions will cause issues
    And I should receive recommendations for optimal policy configuration

  Scenario: Microsoft Family Safety service unavailability handling
    Given Microsoft Family Safety service becomes temporarily unavailable
    When the local system detects the service outage
    Then I should see a warning notification about Family Safety unavailability
    And I should see that local security policies remain fully operational
    And I should see that time management features are degraded gracefully
    And I should see estimated time until service availability check retry
    And I should receive guidance on manual time limit enforcement if needed
    And security policies should continue enforcement regardless of Family Safety status

  Scenario: Cross-platform policy synchronization
    Given Daniel uses both Windows PC and Android device with Family Safety
    When I verify cross-platform integration
    Then I should see that time limits are synchronized across devices
    And I should see that bonus time granted on mobile applies to PC
    And I should see that PC time usage counts toward total daily limit
    And I should see that content filtering policies are consistent
    And I should confirm that local Windows security policies don't interfere with mobile sync
    And I should receive confirmation that the system integrates well with the broader Family Safety ecosystem
