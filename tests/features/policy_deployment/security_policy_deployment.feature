    And I should see network configuration tools access restricted
    And I should see hotspot connection blocking enabled successfully
    And I should receive confirmation that network policies are active
    And I should be able to test connectivity to allowed networks only

  Scenario: Application Control Policies deployment
    Given I select "Deploy Application Control Policies" from the policy menu  
    And I have configured "Microsoft Edge Only" browser policy
    And I have selected application control enforcement level as "Strict"
    When I execute the application control deployment
    Then I should see WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control) policy deployed
    And I should see alternative browser blocking configured (Chrome, Firefox, Opera)
    And I should see portable browser executable detection enabled
    And I should see software restriction policies applied successfully
    And I should see development tool monitoring configured
    And I should receive confirmation that only approved applications can execute
    And I should be able to verify that restricted applications are blocked

  Scenario: Family-specific policy configuration and deployment
    Given I select "Deploy Family Control Policies" from the policy menu
    And I have configured family member accounts: ["daniel", "parent1", "parent2"]
    And I have configured Microsoft Family Safety integration

    Then I should see user account privilege levels configured correctly
    And I should see Microsoft Family Safety time limits validation completed
    And I should see privacy notification system deployed successfully
    And I should see security event logging configured successfully
    And I should see daily email summary system configured
    And I should see network share log access configured
    And I should receive confirmation that family policies are operational

  Scenario: Policy deployment failure detection and rollback
    Given I am deploying security policies
    And a PowerShell execution policy prevents script execution
    When the policy deployment encounters the execution policy error
    Then I should see a clear error message explaining the PowerShell restriction
    And I should see automatic rollback initiation message
    And I should see rollback progress for each deployed policy
    And I should receive confirmation that rollback completed successfully
    And I should see guidance for resolving the PowerShell execution policy issue
    And I should have option to retry deployment after manual resolution

  Scenario: Incremental policy deployment with dependency checking
    Given some security policies are already deployed
    And I want to add additional network restrictions
    When I select incremental policy deployment
    Then I should see current policy status assessment
    And I should see dependency analysis for new policies
    And I should see conflict detection with existing policies
    And I should see recommended deployment order
    And I should be able to deploy only the additional policies
    And existing policies should remain unchanged and functional

  Scenario: Policy validation and compliance testing post-deployment
    Given security policies have been deployed successfully
    When I execute post-deployment validation
    Then I should see automated compliance testing results
    And I should see confirmation that Essential 8 controls are active
    And I should see network restrictions are properly enforced
    And I should see application control policies are blocking unauthorized software
    And I should see user account privileges are correctly restricted
    And I should see security logging is operational and writing events
    And I should receive a comprehensive validation report
