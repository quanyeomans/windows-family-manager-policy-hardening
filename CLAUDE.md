## Current Session 
**Active Work:** [Update each session]  
**Current Phase:** [Analysis | Implementation | Testing | Deployment]  
**Key Files:** [List main files being worked on]  
**Next Steps:** [Immediate next 2-3 actions]

## Quick Decision Tree (Pick ONE)

## Critical Rules (Always Apply)
- **Security First:** Never log API keys or secrets
- **Test First:** Write failing test before implementation
- **Contract Protection:** Interface changes need contract tests
- **Clean Commits:** Atomic commits with clear messages
- **Compliance Gate:** All quality gates must pass

## Application Type Context
**Type:** Hybrid Family Control System (Microsoft Family Safety + Windows Hardening)
**Stack:** PowerShell 7 + Windows Group Policy + Microsoft Cloud Services
**Security Model:** Two-tier (Hard boundaries + Monitored activities)

## Quality Gates (MUST PASS)
```bash
# Run before any commit
powershell -File ./scripts/compliance-check.ps1
# OR manually:
powershell -Command "Invoke-Pester tests/security/ && Test-PolicyCompliance && Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer src/"
```

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Development cycle
powershell -Command "Invoke-Pester tests/ -Tag Contract,Unit"

# Pre-commit safety
powershell -Command "Invoke-Pester tests/ -Tag Contract,Critical"

# Full validation
powershell -File ./scripts/test-all.ps1

# Security audit
powershell -File ./scripts/security-audit.ps1
```
