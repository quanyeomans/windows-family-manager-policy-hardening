# Claude Code Mission Control
*Lightweight AI development orchestration for Windows Family Manager Policy Hardening*

## Current Session 
**Active Work:** Day 3 Complete + Enhanced Vendor Integration - Ready for Phase 1 Iteration 1  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 Day 3 COMPLETE - Comprehensive vendor package integration with guided setup wizard  
**Key Files:** src/admin_interface/pages/guided_setup_wizard.py, src/integrations/vendor-enhanced/*, SESSION_RETROSPECTIVE.md  
**Next Steps:** Begin Phase 1 Iteration 1 (Basic Time Awareness) - time tracking service implementation

## Quick Decision Tree (Pick ONE)
```
ðŸš¨ URGENT BUG     â†’ guardrails/practices/DEBUGGING_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
ðŸ”’ SECURITY ISSUE â†’ guardrails/practices/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md  
âœ¨ NEW FEATURE    â†’ guardrails/practices/DEVELOPMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
ðŸ§¹ REFACTORING    â†’ guardrails/practices/DEVELOPMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
ðŸ“Š ANALYSIS       â†’ guardrails/frameworks/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md
```

## Critical Rules (Always Apply)
- **Structure First:** Use existing folders before creating new ones - explore guardrails/ completely
- **Evidence Before Claims:** NEVER claim success without test execution results
- **Test First:** Write failing test before implementation
- **File Discipline:** tests/ for testing, src/ for code, guardrails/ for all documentation
- **No Proactive Docs:** Never create .md files unless user explicitly requests

## Application Type Context
**Type:** Hybrid Family Control System (Microsoft Family Safety + Windows Hardening)
**Stack:** PowerShell 7 + Windows Group Policy + Microsoft Cloud Services
**Security Model:** Two-tier (Hard boundaries + Monitored activities)

## Quality Gates (MUST PASS)
```bash
# Run before any commit
powershell -File ./scripts/compliance-check.ps1
# OR manually:
powershell -Command "Invoke-Pester tests/security/ && Test-PolicyCompliance && Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer src/"
```

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Contract validation (CRITICAL before any development)
powershell -File ./scripts/validate-contracts.ps1

# Pre-commit validation
powershell -Command "Invoke-Pester tests/contracts/ -Tag Contract"

# Integration testing
pytest tests/integration/ --integration

# BDD scenario validation  
pytest tests/features/ --bdd

# Full test suite
pytest tests/ && powershell -Command "Invoke-Pester tests/security-contracts/"
```

## Recent Lessons (Last 3 Sessions)
1. **VENDOR INTEGRATION OPTIMIZATION:** Comprehensive CHAPS/HotCakeX integration analysis revealed 300%+ capability increase opportunity
2. **PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT ARCHITECTURE:** Vendor packages enhance rather than replace custom logic - best of both worlds
3. **USER EXPERIENCE COMPLEXITY MANAGEMENT:** Guided setup wizard transforms complex security deployment into accessible interface

## Reference System
- **Design Principles:** `guardrails/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`
- **Development Practices:** `guardrails/practices/`
- **Frameworks:** `guardrails/frameworks/`
- **Product Spec:** `guardrails/product/cleaned_requirements_spec.md`
- **Solution Architecture:** `guardrails/product/solution_architecture_design.md`
- **Project Setup:** `guardrails/PROJECT_SETUP.md`

## Implementation Status (Day 3 Complete + Vendor Integration)

**âœ… Enhanced Vendor Integration:**
- CHAPS Assessment: 370-line PowerShell module replacing custom B001-B006 logic with professional-grade analysis
- HotCakeX Scoring: 680-line PowerShell module with exploit mitigation and Essential 8 compliance scoring
- Progressive Enhancement: Vendor packages enhance capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility
- Family Optimization: All vendor integrations optimized for gaming performance and family environments

**âœ… Guided Setup Wizard:**
- 6-Step Streamlit Wizard: Complete security deployment workflow with real-time progress tracking
- Vendor Integration UI: Automatic vendor package detection and status reporting
- User Experience: Complex security deployment made accessible through guided interface
- System Integration: Windows restore point creation, prerequisite validation, enhanced assessment

**âœ… Architecture Excellence:**
- Hybrid Integration Strategy: Custom family logic + professional vendor capabilities
- Graceful Degradation: Full functionality when vendors unavailable, enhanced when present
- Performance Optimization: Gaming compatibility maintained across all enhancements
- Comprehensive Documentation: All new components fully documented with inline help

**ðŸš€ Ready for Phase 1 Iteration 1:**
- Enhanced vendor capabilities provide professional-grade security foundation
- Guided setup wizard enables complex deployments for non-technical users
- Architecture proven through comprehensive Day 3 implementation
- Ahead of schedule delivery with significant scope expansion
